# obsidian-capture-app

A helper web app that allows:

- generating bookmarks that function as a web clipper [^1]
- generating add-to-home screen views to quickly add content to Obsidian without relying on iOS shortcuts.

[^1]: Safari Web Extensions, and therefore the Obsidian Web Clipper, are only supported on iOS Safari, not other browsers such as Firefox iOS or Chrome iOS.
